# curt_prime_num

This is a web application that will generate for the user a variable number of prime numbers, starting with 2.

To run, you must have both `python` and `pip` installed on your system.

For Debian systems:
```
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip
``` 

For Max OSX:
```
brew install python
```

After installation, simply run `python prime.py` in it's home directory, and it will host a web-app on port 80 (by default)
